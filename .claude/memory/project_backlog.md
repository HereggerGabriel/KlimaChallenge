40. ~~**#42 Manual date/time for trips (backfill)**~~ — DONE. Native `@react-native-community/datetimepicker` (plugin added to app.config.ts). iOS: spinner inline + "Done" button. Android: system dialog. Single `date` Date state in both modals — no more separate hour/minute strings. Requires custom dev build (not Expo Go).
41. ~~**Recent trips rework**~~ — DONE. Main screen: date group headers ("Today"/"Yesterday"/date) on 5-trip preview; cards simplified to transport+time. "See all X trips" navigates to new `/trips` screen. New `app/trips.tsx`: filter chips (All/Bus/Train/Tram/Subway), full date-grouped list, swipe-left-to-delete (RNGH Pan, -80px threshold, red zone, 200ms fly-off). New `utils/tripGrouping.ts` shared helper. Deleted dead stubs `app/new-trip.tsx` + `app/trip/[id].tsx`.
42. ~~**Profile layout rework + My Trips shortcut**~~ — DONE. New order: Avatar → Display Name + KlimaTicket + Save → nav shortcuts group (Stats / Achievements / My Trips) → Danger Zone. "My Trips" navigates to `/trips`.

**Completed (session 13, 2026-03-17):**

36. ~~**#36 Delete All — reset quests/achievements**~~ — DONE. `AsyncStorage.multiRemove` for all 4 quest/achievement keys in `handleDeleteAllTrips`.
37. ~~**#37 Remove initialTrips demo fallback**~~ — DONE. `loadTrips()` returns `[]` when key absent.
38. ~~**#38 Profile dropdown close on outside tap**~~ — DONE. Absolute `TouchableWithoutFeedback` overlay (zIndex 10).
39. ~~**#41 Empty states — Stats & Quests**~~ — DONE. Stats: full empty state replacing zero-data sections. Quests: info banner.

**Completed (session 9, 2026-03-16):**

30. ~~**Stats & Insights screen**~~ — DONE. app/stats.tsx; 4 stat cards; KlimaTicket progress; WeeklyBarChart (custom View); Transport Mix; Top Routes; CO2 with long-press tooltip.
31. ~~**Stats entry point (FinancialOverview donut)**~~ — DONE. Donut wheel tappable via onStatsPress prop → /stats.
32. ~~**Stats entry point (profile)**~~ — DONE. "Stats & Insights" button in profile → /stats.
33. ~~**Normalise trip.date on load**~~ — CLOSED. Already resolved; `loadTrips()` does `date: new Date(trip.date)` on parse.

**Completed (session 15, 2026-03-16):**

43. ~~**#45 Haptic feedback**~~ — DONE. `expo-haptics` (already installed). Impact (Medium) on trip add via QuickAdd; Impact (Light) on favorite add; Notification (Success) on level-up, quest claim, achievement claim, main quest claim; Impact (Medium) on swipe-delete in trips.tsx.
44. ~~**#43 Streak system**~~ — DONE. `utils/streakSystem.ts` → `computeStreak(trips)`: consecutive-day streak ending today or yesterday. Displayed in `UserLevelCard` footer as 🔥 Xd (red, `Palette.red.light`, `MaterialIcons local-fire-department`). Computed via `useMemo([trips])` in user.tsx. Hidden when streak = 0.

**Completed (session 16, 2026-03-16):**

45. ~~**Streak milestone rewards**~~ — DONE. `STREAK_MILESTONES` (3/7/14/30/60/100 days → 50/150/300/600/1000/2000 XP) in `utils/streakSystem.ts`. `getNewMilestoneXP(streak, claimed)` returns bonus XP + newly-hit milestone day-counts. `claimedMilestones` state loaded on init/focus. After each trip add, `checkStreakMilestones` fires; if a milestone is hit, XP awarded 1.8s after trip toast (with haptic + level-up if needed). Claimed set persisted to `@claimedStreakMilestones`.
46. ~~**#47 "Log Again" (replaces recurring-trip backlog item)**~~ — DONE. `onLogAgain` prop on `TripDetailModal`; view mode shows two-button row: "Close" + green "Log Again" (replay icon). Tapping closes detail modal, populates `prefillData` state, opens `QuickAddTripModal`. `QuickAddTripModal` gains optional `prefill` prop (PrefillData type); `useEffect([visible])` populates fields when modal opens with prefill. Date always resets to now.

**Completed (session 17, 2026-04-15):**

47. ~~**Trello board export + sync script**~~ — DONE. Created full Trello board via API (5 lists, 70 cards, effort/category labels). Built `trello_sync.js` CLI tool (add/done/move/update/find/lists/cards/archive-done). Credentials in `.env` (gitignored). Added Trello sync step to CLAUDE.md end-of-session checklist.
